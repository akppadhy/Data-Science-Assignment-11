    "1. How do word embeddings capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing?\n",
    "Ans. Word embeddings capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing by representing words as dense vector representations in a continuous space. \n",
    "These vector representations are learned from large amounts of text data using techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText. The underlying idea is \n",
    "that words with similar meanings or that appear in similar contexts should have similar vector representations. By leveraging the distributional \n",
    "properties of words, word embeddings can capture semantic relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain the concept of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their role in text processing tasks.\n",
    "Ans. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network architecture that can process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that \n",
    "carries information from previous steps. RNNs have loops within their structure, allowing them to capture dependencies and relationships between\n",
    "elements in a sequence. In text processing tasks, RNNs are commonly used to model sequences of words or characters, making them well-suited for tasks \n",
    "like language modeling, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the encoder-decoder concept, and how is it applied in tasks like machine translation or text summarization?\n",
    "Ans. The encoder-decoder concept is commonly used in tasks like machine translation or text summarization, where the input sequence needs to be \n",
    "transformed into an output sequence. The encoder part of the model processes the input sequence and converts it into a fixed-length vector \n",
    "representation called the \"context vector\" or \"thought vector.\" This vector represents the input sequence's meaning and is passed to the decoder.\n",
    "The decoder generates the output sequence by taking the context vector and producing one element of the output sequence at a time, considering both \n",
    "the previous generated elements and the context vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Discuss the advantages of attention-based mechanisms in text processing models.\n",
    "Ans. Attention-based mechanisms in text processing models address the limitation of traditional encoder-decoder architectures by allowing the model\n",
    "to focus on different parts of the input sequence when generating each element of the output sequence. Instead of relying solely on the fixed-length\n",
    "context vector, attention mechanisms enable the model to assign different weights or \"attention scores\" to different parts of the input sequence.\n",
    "This way, the model can selectively attend to the most relevant information for generating each output element. Attention mechanisms improve the \n",
    "models ability to handle long input sequences, align words between the input and output sequences, and capture complex relationships within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Explain the concept of self-attention mechanism and its advantages in natural language processing.\n",
    "Ans. The self-attention mechanism, also known as the transformer or scaled dot-product attention, is a key component of attention-based models in \n",
    "natural language processing (NLP). Unlike traditional attention mechanisms that attend to different parts of the input sequence, self-attention\n",
    "focuses on different positions within the same input sequence. \n",
    "It allows the model to capture dependencies between different words in the sequence without relying on sequential processing. Self-attention computes\n",
    "attention weights by comparing the relevance of each word to every other word in the sequence, capturing both local and global relationships. This \n",
    "mechanism helps the model understand the contextual relationships between words, capture long-range dependencies, and improve performance on various \n",
    "NLP tasks such as machine translation, language modeling, and text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the transformer architecture, and how does it improve upon traditional RNN-based models in text processing?\n",

    "\n",
    "*Text Encoding: Convert input text into a numerical representation suitable for the model. This may involve techniques like tokenization, word \n",
    "embeddings, or character-level encoding.\n",

    "dialogue context and maintain coherence:\n",
    "*Context representation: Models need to encode the dialogue history in a meaningful way. This can be achieved using techniques like recurrent neural\n",
    "networks (RNNs), transformers, or memory networks to capture the context and retain relevant information for generating responses.\n",
